            <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>

        <p>
            While the Departments of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics have implemented wait lists for some of their courses, they are offered strictly on a first come, first served basis (there is no re-ordering or prioritizing of the wait lists).  There is no mechanism to request priority consideration in a wait list.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, if you have <b>EXCEPTIONAL NEED</b> for a course, you may use this form to instead request a registration override, which will allow you immediate registration access.
            <br>
            <em>If your need is not exceptional, you should stop now.</em>
            <br>
            You may still place your name on a wait list if one exists, take a different section if one is open, or delay taking the course to a later semester.
        </p>
        <p><u>INSTRUCTIONS:</u></p>
            <p>
                <em>If your request is granted, you will receive an email and your request will be archived in your Override Profile</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Granted:</em> Overrides will be granted on the basis of EXCEPTIONAL NEED after all information has been verified by our office for accuracy.
            </p>

            <p>
                <em>Denied:</em> If your request is denied, you will be notified by an email
                from the department office administrative assistant.
            </p>
        
        
        <p>Most override requests are granted or denied within 2 days.</p>
        <p>
            <b>If the override is approved,</b> the student has <u>3 DAYS</u> to add the course.  After three days, the override may be revoked.  If the student applies the override after the Free Add/Drop Period, a <b>$50 fee</b> will be assessed to the studentâ€™s account regardless of when the override was granted.
