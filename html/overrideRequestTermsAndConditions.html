           <ul>
               <li>Wait Lists are offered strictly on a first come, first served basis (there is no re-ordering or prioritizing of the wait lists). There is no mechanism to request priority consideration in a wait list.</li>
               <li>Override Requests will only be considered on the basis of <strong>exceptional need</strong>. If you do not have exceptional need, do not submit an override request.</li>
               <li>If you've submitted an override request, you can still place your name on a wait list if one exists, take a different section if one is open, or delay the course to a later semester.</li>
               <li>Most override requests are granted or denied within 2 business days.</li>
               <li><strong>If the request is approved and entered into Banner,</strong> the student has <strong>3 calendar days</strong> to add the course.
                <ul>
                    <li>After 3 days, the override is subject to being revoked.</li>
                    <li>If the student applies the override after the free add/drop period, a <strong>$50 fee</strong> will be assessed to the student's account, regardless of when the override was granted.</li>
