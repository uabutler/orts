    <title>Override Request Terms and Conditions</title>
</head>
<body>
    
    <p>While the Departments of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics have implemented wait lists for some of their courses, they are offered strictly on a first come, first served basis (there is no re-ordering or prioritizing of the wait lists).  There is no mechanism to request priority consideration in a wait list.</p>
    <p>
        However, if you have <b>EXCEPTIONAL NEED</b> for a course, you may use this form to instead request a registration override, which will allow you immediate registration access.
        <br>
            <center><b>If your need is not exceptional, you should stop now.</b> </center>
        <br>
        You may still place your name on a wait list if one exists, take a different section if one is open, or delay taking the course to a later semester.
    </p>

                Overrides will be granted on the basis of EXCEPTIONAL NEED after all information has been verified by our office for accuracy.

    <div id="row"></div>
        <div id="column">
            <h3> Granted </h3>
            <p>
                If your request is granted, you will receive an email and your request will be archived in your Override Profile
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="column">
            <h3> Denied </h3>
            <p>
                If your request is denied, you will be notified by an email
                from the department office administrative assistant.
            </p>
        </div>
    
    
    <p>Most override requests are granted or denied within 2 days.</p>
        <p>
            <b>If the override is approved,</b> the student has <u>3 DAYS</u> to add the course.  After three days, the override may be revoked.  If the student applies the override after the Free Add/Drop Period, a <b>$50 fee</b> will be assessed to the studentâ€™s account regardless of when the override was granted.
