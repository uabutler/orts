<h3 style="font-family: nexabold,sans-serif">PLEASE READ ALL OF THE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE FILLING OUT THE ENTIRE
    FORM. ONLY FORMS FILLED OUT CORRECTLY WILL BE CONSIDERED.</h3>

While the Departments of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Statistics have implemented wait lists for some
of their courses, they are offered strictly on a first come, first served basis (there is no re-ordering or
prioritizing of the wait lists). There is no mechanism to request priority consideration in a wait list.<br>
<br>
However, if you have <i>EXCEPTIONAL NEED</i> for a course, you may use this form to instead request a
registration override, which will allow you immediate registration access. <i>If your need is not
    exceptional, you should stop now.</i> You may still place your name on a wait list if one exists, take a
different section if one is open, or delay taking the course to a later semester.<br>
<h3 style="font-family: nexabold, sans-serif">INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
Overrides will be granted on the basis of <i>EXCEPTIONAL NEED</i> after all information has been verified by our
office for accuracy.<br>
<br>
When filling out the form, fill out the semester you're registering for, the course department code, course
number, and section number. Then, verify that the title and CRN are for the correct course before submitting.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: nexabold, sans-serif"><b>If the override is granted,</b></span> an announcement
will appear under your Student Tab → Registration → Registration Status in TruView.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: nexabold, sans-serif"><b>If the override is denied,</b></span> you will be notified
by an email from the department office administrative assistant.<br>
<br>
Most override requests are granted or denied within 2 days.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: nexabold, sans-serif"><b>If the override is approved,</b></span> the student has 3
DAYS to add the course. After three days, the override may be revoked. If the student applies the override
after the Free Add/Drop Period, a $50 fee will be assessed to the student’s account regardless of when the
override was granted.
